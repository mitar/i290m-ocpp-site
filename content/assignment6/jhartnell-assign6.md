Summary: Funding Hypothes.is

ASSIGNMENT 6: Where does the funding for you community come from? Is there corporate sponsorship? A foundation that backs it? Do users donate? How does this affect the community's cooperative dynamics? Are there competing projects? How would you describe your project's role in the greater technical ecosystem?

We get the bulk of our funding from a number of foundations: Knight, Mellon, and Sloan to name a few. We are also funded by contributions from users. As a non-profit and open source projects, we don't really have competing projects. As for how this affects the community's cooperative dynamics, I would argue that it is one of the key reasons why we have had people become very enthusiastic about the project. 

To summarize in the way I usually explain to people: our purpose is to make open annotation of the web a reality. We're not in this to make money, but rather change the world. Our role is building basic web infrastructure that everyone can use and copy.
