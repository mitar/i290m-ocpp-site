Summary: Details about the community participation.

----------
“I pick and choose the work that’s most interesting to me. It’s great when you find a challenging problem to work on—either on your own or because someone needs it—you can spend hours on it.” This first line from the [paper] “Motivation, Governance, and the Viability of Hybrid Forms in Open Source Software Development” by Sonali Shah summarizes my reasons to join open source pretty well. After my failed attempt to join another open source project, joining [Freelaw project] was a good experience. As soon as I registered with the community I received a welcome message from [Mike Lissner], the founder and lead developer in the community, explaining the motive of the project and appreciating my involvement.

As opposed to my previous attempt to join another open source community, this time I knew exactly the intent of my contribution, which was “the enhancement of opinions on courtlistener.com by identifying and extracting relevant key-terms for each opinion”. These key-terms can then be used to create a tagsonomy and provide users of courtlistener.com another means of navigating relevant opinions.

Since there are very few contributors currently in this project so I was little worried about the commit process of the project and me stepping onto someone else’s toes, but when I learnt that there was a separate [branch] created for our commits I was relieved because as Fogel says “[Version Control Means You Can Relax]”.

I started by installing Freelaw Virtual Machine on my laptop. It is a complete instance of the entire website courtlistener.com and Juriscraper, the scraping engine that courtlistener.com uses to retrieve court opinions from public websites. Initially I faced a lot of issues while setting up the whole environment needed for development but the prompt responses from other contributors helped me to overcome these issues pretty quickly. This kind of response from other contributors not only made this whole process smooth but also kept me motivated to continue my contribution to this project.
