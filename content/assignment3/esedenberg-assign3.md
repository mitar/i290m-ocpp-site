###Participation in Citizen Science Via Zooniverse

Participating in citizen science is facile -- figuring out how to contribute to citizen science in a way meaningful to the class was more difficult. I selected Zooniverse because it makes a model citizen science initiative. I was intrigued by Zooniverse's diversity of hosted projects (topics include: space, climate, nature, the humanities, and biology), the success of past projects, and the scale of participating volunteers. Zooniverse is a model for how large scale data processing can be crowd sourced and how a future of "open science" may evolve to include untrained, "average" participants. 

In retrospection, I should have chosen a smaller citizen science project and perhaps one that met in person -- ironic considering how this was a class designed to occur almost entirely online. I began by contributing observations or classifications to three different projects: [Notes from Nature](https://www.zooniverse.org/project/notes_from_nature) which uses UC Berkeley "Cal Bug" [data](http://calbug.berkeley.edu/); [Seafloor Explorer](https://www.zooniverse.org/project/seafloorexplorer); and [Cyclone Center](https://www.zooniverse.org/project/cyclonecenter). 

I reached out to the CalBug UC Berkeley Essig Museum and was put in contact with the science project lead/coordinator here at Berkeley (who happens to also be a PhD Candidate). I reached out to Zooniverse and pitched my idea to study community involvement since I observed that citizen science, at least in the Zooniverse case, seemed to be more of an identity than a community. My contact at Zooniverse was very friendly, answered my questions about the organization that may not be readily apparent from the website or articles (see other blog posts for more detail about the organization) and was supportive about my idea to study the community forums and look at how the scientific team involvement influences community participation and overall progress on the project. Unlike a platform like GithHub, you cannot readily tell how much someone is contributing to a project and community dynamics are much different than other open projects. Since an underlying goal of citizen science is to engage as many individuals (usually untrained) as possible, there is little barrier to entry in projects like Zooniverse and there may be so many people contributing patchwork observations to a single project there is not much emphasis on forming a community. In several of the forums, I have seen leaders appear to emerge from the community but most group discussions center around problem solving or pointing out cool observations found in the data. Citizen science is inherently a top down organizational structure, since there are ultimately project principal investigators who will synthesize the crowd sourced data. Zooniverse has one project, [Galaxy Zoo Quench](http://quench.galaxyzoo.org/) that offers a platform to crowdsource the scientific analysis.

I am interested in understanding the participation rates and how participation changes over time by studying differences in Zooniverse's individual projects. How might the technical infrastructure and the engagement of the scientific team play a role in these differences? From my observations, it seems like there isn't much interaction between the average user which consequently makes participation more of a label or identity instead of an active community. Not all of the projects have the same platform so I might be able to compare projects with different features as well as tease apart how the researchers feel about the participants and vice versa. This is a  marked difference from many of key themes illustrated in von Krogh (2003) or systems that rank participants, like the case pointed out in Gulley (2010). However, this model that lacks a connected community was also seen in projects such as FoldIt (Cooper, 2010),  this may just be part of the landscape for citizen science.

My contact at Zooniverse has agreed to send me forum data, but this process has taken much longer than I anticipated. If prompted, I can provide email proof of these communications dating back through the beginning of October. I am committed to complete this portion of research for the Zooniverse committee, and will be taking this research on into next semester. Though it did not fit neatly within the semester of this class, this involvement has increased my understanding of how citizen science (and platforms like Zooniverse) will play a role in a new era of "open science" and led me to a new research area that will inform and contribute to my dissertation research topic.
