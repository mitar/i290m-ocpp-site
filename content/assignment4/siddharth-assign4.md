Summary: Details about the governance model.

----------

Freelaw project is a nonprofit public benefit corporation, which is organized under the Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable purposes. Corporation has Dr. Brian W. Carver and Michael Lissner [appointed] as its directors. 

There is also [Conflict of Interest and Ethics policy document] for Freelaw Corporation, which dictates the different transactions or arrangements that might benefit the private interest of a director, officer or other person in a position of authority within the Corporation. It also states that policy is intended to supplement but not replace any state and federal laws governing conflicts of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations. They also have bylaws defined for the corporation which can be found [here].

Right from the day I joined this community I didn’t feel that there was any hidden power dynamics which follow decision making in the project. I observed that Freelaw project follows Benevolent Dictatorship model as its governance model. My project partner and I were directly communicating with Mike and Dr. Carver to get approval on our decisions. All the decisions were mutually agreed or disagreed upon by both of them. The small size of the community played to my advantage in this case as against the previous community I tried to join which was significantly big. All my queries and doubts were answered pretty quickly which saved a lot of time and effort, which otherwise is wasted on discussion mailers. 

Since Mike had planned to go on a sabbatical for next few months, he decided to come to i-school and give a presentation about architecture and code walkthrough of courtlistener.com. This session was pretty useful and if any contributor had further doubts, Mike was reachable on his IM/mail to resolve them. Once we were familiar with the structure of the courtlistener.com, we started the actual work and kept conducting regular meetings with Dr. Carver to keep him updated with our progress. 

Since the community is new and small, till now I don’t think that there have been many issues regarding any decision making, but as the community will grow I am sure these issues are bound to occur. But as this whole project itself deals with Law and jurisdiction, and all the rules and regulations are already in place, I am sure that directors will be able to handle those issues smoothly.
