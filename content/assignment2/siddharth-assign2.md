Report on the history, infrastructure, and demographics of the project.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chromium is the open source web browser project from which Google Chrome draws its source code. The Chromium Project takes its name from the element chromium (24 Cr) used for chrome plating. Google's intention, was that Chromium would be the name of the open source project and that the final product name would be Chrome, however other versions have been released by the developers under the Chromium name.

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, 
faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web. One of the questions often asked by people is: *What's the difference between Chromium OS and Google Chrome OS?* Well, Chromium OS is the open source project, used primarily by developers, with code that is available for anyone to checkout, modify, and build. Google Chrome OS is the Google product that OEMs ship on Chromebooks for general consumer use.

Google Chrome was first introduced in September 2008, and along with its release, the Chromium source code was also made available allowing builds to be constructed from it. The initial code release included builds for Windows and OS X, as well as Linux, although the latter was at a very early stage of development and lacked complete functionality.

Here's the consolidated list of releases and their significant features:

- Chromium 13.0 was released on 26 April 2011, included a menu button to enable users to switch between multiple Google profiles, multi-selection of tabs and an improved omnibox engine(address bar).
- Chromium 14.0 was released on 2 June 2011, included about:flags testing support for preload instant search, permitting the user to preload the default search engine used in instant search and GPU-acceleration on all pages.
- Chromium 15.0 was released on 28 July 2011, gained a "self-crashing" feature that crashes the browser if a close command is not completed in 25 seconds. smooth scrolling when using the space bar, automatic pre- and auto-logins to Google's own web pages.

Why is the project open? Is it for ideological reasons, or practical reasons, or both?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Google has Open Source Programs Office, which is tasked with maintaining a healthy relationship with the open source software development community.
Google has released over 20 million lines of code and over 900 projects. Many engineers work on open source projects full time, and even more use their 20% time to create new projects or contribute to their favourite existing projects.
Apart from Chromium, there are other open source projects from Google such as Android, Closure Tools, Ganeti, Gerrit, Go, Google Web Toolkit, Native Client, Tesseract OCR, V8 JavaScript Engine, WebM, and ZXing.
Full list is available at this [link].

How big is the community? Where are its members located? How did you find out?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the discussion forums I have seen contributors mainly from US and few of them from India but I am still working on getting the concrete details about the demographics of this project.


What kind of product is it and how is it licensed?
--------------------------------------------------
The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the BSD license, with other parts being subject to a variety of different open-source licenses, including the MIT License, the LGPL, the Ms-PL and an MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license.

What sort of infrastructure does it use? Why does it use those tools and not other options?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on my research I found the following tools being used for Chromium development:

- Chromedriver:
One of the tools which I found is a webdriver called chromedriver. 
WebDriver is an open source tool for automated testing of webapps across many browsers. 
It provides capabilities for navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, 
and more. ChromeDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol 
for Chromium. It is being developed by members of the Chromium and WebDriver teams.

- WebKit project documentation is used as a reference guide for writing a reduced test case.

I will keep updating this section as and when I get to know more about the other tools which are used in the development process.
