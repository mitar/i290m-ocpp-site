Summary: Second Assignment
The mission of MIFOS is to unlock the potential of microfinance in order to expedite the trek out of poverty for users globally. Here in first world countries, we take for granted the fact that we have relative ease in accessing loans. We don’t realize how much a loan can quicken the process to set up a business and lift an individual up on their feet. To put it in perspective, I can’t imagine how long it would take most of us to purchase a home without the help of loans. My family’s mortgage hasn’t been paid off yet after 7 years so effectively, we still wouldn’t be able to own a home by now. 
However, financial institutions dislike extending smaller loan amounts because the amount of servicing and maintenance required is not worth the return. This is where MIFOS steps in. MIFOS is a free open source financial software that is given out to financial institutions worldwide in order to induce and encourage easier and increased amounts of loans. 

The money can be used to start businesses that earn income like purchasing a goat or a sheep making a small store, etc. These small businesses bring in more income for their family than could otherwise be provided with zero funds. This could be the difference between their kids going hungry and having enough food or the difference between having a sturdy roof or one that gets carried off into the storm. These endeavors can make the difference between poverty and not. 


Originally, MIFOS was open source because its mission was to help alleviate poverty globally. The software was pioneered by the Grameen Foundation because they wanted to address one of the biggest barriers of growth to Microfinance Institutions globally: the lack of capital and the lack of software(reducing servicing/maintenance costs)  The lack of capital is highly correlated with the lack of transparent portfolio software because investors feel uneasy about not being able to actively monitor their potential investment. So, Grameen endeavored to create MFI software in order to break the barriers on growth and they initially chose to make it open source because they believed that altruistic volunteers worldwide would be enough manpower to drive and maintain the program. However, this model quickly failed because the initiative couldn’t attract enough contributors and unpaid volunteers weren’t enough to maintain and operate a demanding global software where challenges arose from all corners of the Earth.   

However, MIFOS realized an operational efficiency that they did not take into account when they entered this sector. They found that Microfinance Institutions wanted to voluntarily contribute and pay MIFOS because this would minimize software maintenance costs. This was vastly superior and more cost and time efficient than each MFI building their own software because they would be responsible for maintenance and software improvements as time goes on. MFIs also pushed their own changes and contributions to the software.  That way, the cost of maintenance, improvements, tech support, and everything involved with the software would not fall on to any singular MFI but would instead be shared amongst every MFI that wanted the same features or software.  


The User community involves around 30 different Microfinance Institutions situated in the third world and countless specialists to assist the process. Officially, MIFOS does not specify how many volunteers it is currently hosting. I posted to the mailing list asking if anyone knew of how many contributors MIFOS currently had but no one really responded. This is something that I’ve noticed about the MIFOS community. Scrolling down, I saw two different posts that just said hi and introduced themselves to the community but literally got no response. I think because MIFOS volunteers are segregated and separated into teams immediately upon joining, there’s not much community cohesion and more team based guidance under a supervisor.  This has its benefits and down sides and I guess this could be interpreted as one of the down sides. However, after the surveying the team count for the majority of tasks currently assigned, there are around 90 or so volunteers from what I can tell listed on the website. 

Because MIFOS is open source, MIFOS allows their clients to modify and contribute firm-specific changes to the platform that MIFOS provides. In fact, the newly released MIFOS X platform is designed specifically so that MFIS can build new applications using it as the foundation to use in their institutions. Furthermore, MIFOS customers interact with MFIs through business specialists that help translate their business needs into more technical and concrete improvements that MIFOS could provide. 


The MIFOS product is essentially a platform for micro-finance transactions to be completed through. Its key features are that its low cost, user friendly, and works on low connectivity with global support. The platform can be downloaded independently off of the MIFOS website or any institution can contact a specialist through the website to help guide them through the process.  Its licensed through Apache License V2.0, Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)



As I have stated before, my technical background in coding is not incredibly strong, and the interactions that I’ve had with the MIFOS platform have been limited. From what I gather, MIFOS is a java-based web application running on top of a MySQL Database. Furthermore, they switched from an SVN control system to Github recently. 

My contributions so far have only included documentation and working on transitioning from the old MIFOS program to the very newly executed MIFOS X.
