Oakland Wiki is a synchronous platform, as far as content on the site. The wiki allows anyone, from anywhere to contribute 
to the Oakland-oriented content without having to wait for access or gain permissions. The only action needed is to signup through an account, 
and the editing can begin. 

However, as I mentioned before, in a previous blog post, it's hard to know if a section is ever really "done." It's done until
someone else comes around, and adds more information to it, which in a way is great because it's consistently being updated and built upon. 
In fact, you can see the 'Recent History', or changes and additions, made by all the contributors, making it very socially transparent. Checkout
the history here: http://oaklandwiki.org/Recent_Changes

As far as modularity, there's no assigned tasks or areas within the site. While this allows for fluidity and constant iteration, I struggle with 
the thought of making my additions and changes might be changed after sinking time into it. At what point do open source projects become "done" and 
locked down? I guess for Oakland Wiki, the site is meant to give voices to everyone, and since Oakland is a growing, changing city with new people, 
places and events occurring every day, I guess it will never be "done."
