Summary: Seventh Assignment
Does your project's community mirror the technical modularity of the project? How does it structure its collaboration--synchronously? Asyncronously? How does it get work done?

I firmly believe that Conway’s law affects the MIFOS community but with a twist. Conway’s Law states that organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. In this case of MIFOS I believe that the causality is actually reversed and the community’s organizational structure is a direct result of how the product is designed and produced. 
As I have elaborated in my previous blog posts, MIFOS’ community, or at least the portion of the community that I have had the pleasure of interacting with, is highly segregated.  Tasks are delegated to teams and these teams operate in their own private realms. Teams can have meetings, through Skype primarily, on how to tackle or engage the task at hand but none of this is visible to any individual who’s outside the team.  This effectively limits the ability of any individual who is not on that particular team to being able to contribute to the task that the team is working on. Furthermore, in a side note, I attempted to join a team who has already started on their task and I found a relative reluctance to catch me up to speed to what needs to be done and what has yet to be done.  To that end, I think it’s interesting to note that I don’t identify with individuals in the community, but rather I identify with teams. For example, I may not remember or recognize different contributors’ names but I will remember them as the individual who worked with me on the Reporting team or etc. I believe this model is solely sustainable because of the presence of paid contributors and a benevolent dictator who compiles all of these individual tasks together and pushes them out.
As I have also mentioned previously, even the mailing lists are specialized and split between different types of contributors(Technical and Non-Technical) as well as Users and Specialists. I believe MIFOS does this because it wishes to be organized but the extent that they have differentiated between their community is a bit too excessive in my opinion. They do this to be able to accurately address their intended target whether it is the assignment of a new task(technical or otherwise) or the push of a news update to its users.  This extent of modularity does not foster a sense of community, but as mentioned before, MIFOS has a good drive of paid contributors that it does not need to worry too much about fostering a sense of community. 
The collaboration done is under an asynchronous model in the sense that an individual can work on multiple tasks and participate on multiple teams at once. At one point, I was in three different teams but I dropped out of one because the task at hand was beyond my technical knowledge. I believe in a normal open source community, it would be very hard to drive focus and deadlines if volunteers were spread so thin and assigned so many tasks, but because of the unique nature of MIFOS’ contributor model, it is able to operate efficiently due to the fact that the majority of contributors are paid. In this manner, it is okay for them to be divided into multiple teams because they still have to adhere to deadlines.  Something I wish was discerned is whether or not individuals on my team are paid or not. However, I know that is a rather disrespectful question in some sense and I do not want to ask that. 


My Contributions:
Over the course of this semester I have contributed in various ways to the MIFOS project including participating in a variety of non-technical tasks as well as contributing to the various mailing lists that I have subscribed to. Concretely, I helped update the MIFOS Installation manual linked in my assignment 2 and I have also aided in the translation of a portion of MIFOS X to Spanish.

Below are links to the Spanish translation contributions I have made in imgur platform because I do not how to add screenshots to github :[ Also, I realized I was the only person working on translating it to Spanish so the 4% of MIFOS X that was translated to Spanish was all done by me :]
