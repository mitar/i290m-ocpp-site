# Geonode's community  
Geonode's community involves 3 groups : Users, Developers and Admins. The project caters to these three groups individually through various documentation and online workshops. 

[Users](http://geonode.org/user_features.html) use Geonode software and do not involve much in the development of the project. [Their workshop](http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/index.html#users) mainly deals with as to how to create an account on GeoNode, add layers and maps to your account as well as publishing those.
