\section{Results}

We present the results of both the qualitative and quantitative results  in coherence with the assignments and with the survey, starting with motivations to join a project. We then address the actual joining process in a variety of projects and how the experience relates to all unique communities. As all projects operate at least partially online, we report on the importance of communication tools. We then address governance issues related to joining as well as related business models.
