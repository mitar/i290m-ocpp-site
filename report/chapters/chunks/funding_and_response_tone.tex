\mysubsubsection{Funding and Response Tone}
When separating out the questions on funding, who responded and response tone we can see several interesting trends. While the question asked several different ways that people could be paid for their contributions, it can be simplified to a binary attribute of paid / unpaid. In most cases, there were a mix of funding but in this analysis all that mattered was if there was any financial incentives. Additionally the responses to ``How did the response read" formed a binary attribute as well with all participants selecting either Peer or Teacher.

Though there isn't much data to go by, in funded organizations more people reported the response tone to their initial contribution read as being answered as peers rather than as teachers. Further exploration shows that unlike unfunded projects, in paid organizations it was rarely the project founder who responded but rather a senior project member. This might explain the presence of a more peer-to-peer response tone verse a pedagogical response tone.
