We created this paper as an experiment in collaborative research and writing
on the topic of open collaboration and peer-production, with focus on
open source communities. The paper itself is created in the same manner
as our research subjects are. It covers roughly four perspectives:
perspective on the class itself, on open source communities we have been
involved with during our active participations in sample communities,
perspective around a survey we made to quantify our experiences, and
general broader context of open collaboration and peer-production.
